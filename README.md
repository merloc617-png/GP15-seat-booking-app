# Seat-Booking App

This is a project of a Seat Booking App implemented using vanilla `JavaScript`. It can be easily adjusted to be used in any project that needs to have a simple **seat-reservation system**. Please note that this project is not finished yet.

The app uses `ES6` classes and methods, and also uses modern browser APIs such as `querySelector`, `createElement`, and `localStorage`. It also uses the `crypto` API to generate random ids for services and sectors.

## How it works

The app has three main classes: `SeatBookingApp`, `Service`, and `Sector`.

1. The SeatBookingApp class is responsible for creating instances of Service and Sector, rendering services to the DOM, and caching data to local storage.
   It provides methods to add sectors and services to the app, get the list of services, and set the current service. It renders the services list to the DOM and caches the services to local storage.

2. The Service class represents a service with a name, price, and available seats. It provides methods to book seats, add reserved seats, remove reserved seats, and mark seats as booked. This class provides methods to add and remove reserved seats, calculate their prices and book them.

3. The Sector class represents a sector with a unique id, a price multiplier, and a list of seats in each row. It generates unique seat ids and provides a method to render the sectors to the DOM.

## Bugs

- reserved seats and order details list should be cleared after adding, deleting or modifying current service and after changing services
- when localStorage is empty, everything should be blocked until a service is created and cached in localStorage

## Things to be implemented

- **prompt user to create first service**
- **add input validation and better error handling**
- enable user to update price multipliers for each sector
- enable user to create sectors
  - storing mechanism for sectors is ready (disabled for now)
